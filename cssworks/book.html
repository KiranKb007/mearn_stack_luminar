                For over a decade, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has captivated the world of
                cricket and over a billion Indians with his incredible ingenuity as
                captain, wicketkeeper and batsman. Bharat Sundaresan tracks down the
                cricketer's closest friends in Ranchi and artfully presents the
                different shades of Dhoni-the Ranchi boy, the fauji, the diplomat,
                Chennai's beloved Thala, the wicketkeeping Pythagoras-and lays bare
                the man underneath.
